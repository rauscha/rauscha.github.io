Rausch,\r\n### Medical student at Tufts University in Boston, MA\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nNow in my final year of medical school, I like using data-driven analysis to guide practice.  \r\nPreviously, I've researched subjects ranging from corn genomics, to galactic formation, to multi dimensional MRI image processing.  \r\nAt home, I love to cook --- I dare you to find a better braised short rib!  \r\nAn interesting local craft beer or a well made coffee pourover, I dig well crafted drinks. Ask me, and I can talk brewing techniques for hours!  ","google":"UA-40456028-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
